                        Particulate matter is a complex mixture of solids and liquids, including carbon,
                        complex organic chemicals, sulphates, nitrates, mineral dust, and water suspended in the air.

                        It varies in size. Some particles, such as dust, soot, dirt or smoke are large or dark enough to
                        be
                        seen with the naked eye. But the most damaging particles are the smaller particles, known as
                        PM10and
                        PM2.5. PM10refers to particles with a diameter that’s smaller than 10 microns (10µm) – that’s 10
                        millionths of a metre. PM2.5 refers to particles with a diameter smaller than 2.5 microns, and
                        these
                        are known as fine particles. The smallest fine particles, less than 0.1 micron in diameter, are
                        called ultrafine particles.</p>
                    <p>
                        Particulate matter irritates your nose and throat and may be associated with more severe
                        symptoms in people with asthma. It results in more people with lung conditions (COPD, asthma,
                        bronchitis) and heart conditions (heart attacks, strokes) being admitted to hospital. It also
                        causes early deaths from lung and heart disease.

                <p class="card-content">
                    <p>Nitrogen dioxide is a gas and is a major component of urban air pollution episodes.</p>
                    <p>It comes from man-made sources of nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, are vehicles,
                        power stations and heating. Diesel vehicles are major contributors in urban areas. Roadside
                        levels are highest where traffic is busiest.</p>

                <span class="card-title">Ozone (O3)</span>
                <p class="card-content">
                    <p>Ozone is a gas composed of three atoms of oxygen. In the upper level of the Earth’s atmosphere,
                        it absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation.</p>
                    <p>Near the ground, ozone is made by a chemical reaction between the sun’s rays and organic gases
                        and oxides of nitrogen emitted by cars, power plants, chemical plants and other sources.
                        Levels of ozone tend to be highest in the spring and summer and lowest in the winter. Ozone
                        reaches its peak concentration during the afternoon. Levels are often higher in the country than
                        in towns. Ozone is a major component of summer air pollution episodes.</p>
                    <p>Ozone can irritate the airways of healthy people and people with lung conditions. High levels can
                        cause you discomfort when you breathe, reduce your lung capacity (the amount of air your lungs
                        can hold) and trigger asthma symptoms.

                        If you have a lung condition, high levels of ozone can cause you to have difficulty breathing,
                        to wheeze and to cough. People with asthma may need to use their reliever inhaler more.

                        When there are high levels of ozone, more people are admitted to hospital with asthma-related
                        health problems and COPD symptoms, and there is a greater risk of illnesses like pneumonia and
                        bronchitis.</p>

                <span class="card-title">Sulphur dioxide (SO2)</span>
                <p class="card-content">
                    <p>Sulphur dioxide is a colourless gas, with a pungent, suffocating smell. It’s produced by burning
                        sulphur-containing fuels such as coal and oil. This includes, vehicles, power generation and
                        heating.</p>

                    <p>
                        Most sulphur dioxide comes from electric industries that burn fossil fuels, and also from petrol
                        refineries and cement manufacturing. It can be transported over long distances and contributes
                        to the formation of ozone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sulphur dioxide can irritate the lining of your nose, throat and lungs. It can cause coughing
                        and tightness of your chest, as well as a narrowing of your airway that will reduce the flow of
                        air to your lungs. It inflames the airways, causing coughing and more mucus. It makes conditions
                        like asthma and COPD worse. It makes people more prone to chest infections.

                        People with asthma are much more sensitive to sulphur dioxide than those who do not have asthma.
                        They may find breathing more difficult and have flare-ups when concentrations of sulphur dioxide
                        are high.
